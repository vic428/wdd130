    <p>Hi everyone, it's a pleasure to be a part of this program and i'm excited to see where it'll lead.
        I'm working towards bagging a B.Sc in Applied Technology, i've always wanted to be a part of something that 
        would contribute immensely to the growth of the African Economy and the advancements of technology even in this part of the world
        has endeared me to this career path.</p>

    <p>I enjoy listening to good music to help calm my nerves and to keep me motivated. Music they say brings life to the soul.
       I also enjoy playing sports and video games and i recently took a fondness for reading good books, so far i've read about 3 books from
       3 prominent authors( The Richest Man in Babylon by George Samuel Clayson, Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, Think Big by Ben Carson).
       I've set a goal to read 4 additional books before Decenber 31st, 2023.</p>

    <p>I currently work full time as a fleet officer in the transport and Autmation industry however i desire to work as Web/ Software developer and participating 
        in this course is a step in that direction. I love BYU-Idaho's approach to providing the requisite training that could better prepare one for job roles in
        the tech industry with a potential to learn at ones pace, on the job and grow up the ladder. The instructors are ready to provide guidance when needed. The opportunity to 
        work with different people from different cultural backgrounds and climes across the world helps to create a community of colleagues you can rely on.</p>

    <p>I've been a member of the church since i was as little as 5, i got baptised at 8 and i've been in the church ever since. Just in July 2022, i returned
        from my mission in the Nigeria Lagos Mission West Africa and for me my mission experience was one i'll always cherish. I grew to love the gospel,
        my companions, fellow missionaries, the people i was assigned to serve etc. It was indeed a blessing. I love the words in the begining lines of hymn 128 'I will not doubt, 
        i will not fear, God's love and strength are always near' and the reason i love this is beacuse it helps me understand the need to replace doubt and fear with faith 
        and complete trust in God. Doing so would help me see clearly and move on with my endeavours with a complete assurance that God is in the tiny details of my life.</p>
